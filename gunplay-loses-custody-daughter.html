Visits have to be scheduled and monitored by the court, and are limited to recorded videos, phone calls and messages.</p><p>The decision can only be reversed if Vonshae, who stars in Love & Hip Hop: Miami, requests the court grant him custody.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Gunplay’s estranged wife has also requested child support, with the exact amount to be determined during a later court hearing.</p><p>The 44-year-old rapper has missed three previous court dates regarding the temporary restraining order. Things could get even worse for him if he misses the next one as the restraining order will become permanent, keeping him away from their daughter until she turns 18.</p><p>The ruling comes after <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Gunplay was arrested in August for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, domestic violence, false imprisonment and child abuse</a>.</p><p>Vonshae Taylor-Morales claims he pointed a gun at her while she was holding Osanna after she told him to quiet down while playing Xbox. <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>She also says he choked their daughter during the heated dispute</a>.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Unfortunately, Richard is back using and developed a very bad drinking problem.

Jodi’s former partner is regarded as one of the best professional wrestlers of all time and a WWE legend.</strong></p><h2><span id=What8217s_Her_Estimated_Worth>What’s Her Estimated Worth?</span></h2><p>Given that her job is completely unknown, it is difficult to estimate her actual net worth. Her net worth, according to some sources, is between $500k and $1 million. Conversely, The Undertaker, her ex-husband, is thought to be worth $17 million.</p><h2><span id=Jodi_Lynn_Calaway_Who_Is_She_Her_Age_and_Bio>Jodi Lynn Calaway: Who Is She? Her Age and Bio</span></h2><p>As previously stated, Jodi is the ex-wife of WWE legend The Undertaker. There isn’t much information about her early years because she didn’t come into the public eye until after she married The Undertaker. She did, however, seem to have a good childhood, spending the majority of her early years with her mother and father.</p><p>Conversely, her well-known ex-husband, The Undertaker, was born Mark William Calaway in Housten, Texas, on March 24, 1965. As of 2022, he was 57 years old. We can infer that The Undertaker’s first wife, Jodi, may likewise be in her 50s based on the age of the ex-partner.</p><p>Furthermore, it is believed that she is Caucasian in ethnicity and that she is an American national.</p><h2><span id=What_Does_Jodi_Lynn_Calaway_Do_for_a_Living_in_Her_Profession>What Does Jodi Lynn Calaway Do for a Living in Her Profession?</span></h2><p>Jodi has an opulent lifestyle and ample financial resources. Unfortunately, though, her ex-husband’s celebrity seems to have eclipsed her career. It’s unclear what she does for a living as of now.</p><p>However, as we already noted, her ex-partner is one of the greatest wrestlers of all time. He started his career competing in many gimmicks for World Class Championship Wrestling, but he is well-known throughout the world for his performance as a WWF/E performer.</p><p>He eventually signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later renamed WWE) in 1990 after winning multiple championships. eventually, in his career, he gained immense recognition as The Undertaker.</p><h2><span id=The_Undertaker_and_Jodi_Lynn_Calaway_were_wed_for_ten_years>The Undertaker and Jodi Lynn Calaway were wed for ten years.</span></h2><p>The Undertaker, also known by his stage name Mark William, joined World Championship Wrestling in 1989, the same year that he and Jodi Lynn exchanged vows. The pair was having a great time and was content with their life together.</p><p>They welcomed their child together after 4 years of marriage. However, as time went on, their marriage began to falter, and in 1999 they got divorced. After ten years of marriage, the former couple decided to call it quits.</p><h2><span id=After_divorcing_the_wrestler8217s_husband_did_she_remarry>After divorcing the wrestler’s husband, did she remarry?</span></h2><p>According to the reports, Jodi never got married again. Her son was just 7 years old at the time of the divorce, and it is said that she decided to prioritize raising her child over getting married again.</p><h2><span id=The_ex-husband_of_Jodi_Lynn_Calaway_got_married_twice>The ex-husband of Jodi Lynn Calaway got married twice.</span></h2><p>Following Jodi’s divorce, The Undertaker became engaged to Sara Frank that same year. Later that year, in 2000, they exchanged vows in a covert ceremony. Speaking of Sara, she was a native of California, a lifelong sports enthusiast, and at one point, a professional wrestler. Following that, the pair broke up in 2007.</p><p>Jodi’s ex-husband met Michelle McCool after the second wife’s divorce, and they got married in 2010. Since then, The Undertaker has happily been married to McCool, a former professional wrestler who is currently retired from the sport. Michelle has held the titles of WWE Women’s Champion and WWE Divas Champion twice.</p><h2><span id=She_is_a_son8217s_mother>She is a son’s mother.</span></h2><p>In August 1992, Jodi Lynn and her husband welcomed a son into the world, Gunner Vincent Calaway. As 2022 approaches, Jodi’s lone child has already commemorated his 29th birthday.</p><p>Gunner Vincent Calaway is the kid that Jodi Lynn Calaway and her ex-spouse share. Gunner Vincent Calaway, the son of The Undertaker Jodi Lynn Calaway<br>Her son Gunner currently resides in Nashville and was employed by Concentrix, IT Services, and an IT consulting firm as an information technology system administrator. In addition, he works as a freelance artist.</p><h2><span id=The_Undertaker_the_ex-spouse_of_Jodi_Lynn_is_a_father_of_five>The Undertaker, the ex-spouse of Jodi Lynn, is a father of five.</span></h2><p>As previously mentioned, he was married twice after divorcing his first wife, Jodi Lynn Calaway. The Undertaker has three daughters, Chasey Calaway, Gracie Calaway, and Kaia Faith Calaway, out of his three marriages. Two of the five are sons, Kolt and Gunner Vincent Calaway.</p><p>Jodi Lynn and The Undertaker, who were previously mentioned, are the parents of Gunner. Moreover, his children Chasey and Gracie are from his second marriage to Sara. He is the father of Kaia and Kolt, the children of his current life partner, Michelle.</p><h2><span id=Is_Instagram_Used_by_Jodi_Lynn_Calaway_How_She_Manages_Social_Media>Is Instagram Used by Jodi Lynn Calaway? How She Manages Social Media</span></h2><p>Jodi, the first wife of The Undertaker, is not on any social media platforms. She doesn’t have an account on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. She leads a very private life.</p><p>Her well-known ex-partner, on the other hand, has 4.3 million followers on Instagram under the handle @undertaker. Additionally, Gunner, Lynn’s kid, has 4,126 followers on Instagram under the handle @theshogungun.</p><h2><span id=Jodi_Lynn_Calaway_Where_Is_She_Now>Jodi Lynn Calaway: Where Is She Now?</span></h2><p>Her precise whereabouts are hard to determine.

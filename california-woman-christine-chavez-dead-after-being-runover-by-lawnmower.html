Beard Brook Park in Modesto around noon on July 8 when an employee riding a John Deere tractor with a pull-behind mower swept the area.</p><p>The unidentified worker said he didn’t see the sleeping woman until he “noticed a body in the grass he had already made a pass through,” Modesto police said.</p><p>The employee called 911, but Chavez was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>Family members said their grief has been compounded by what they called a disrespectful, botched clean-up.</p><p>“They left big chunks of her all over the place, just covered up with the grass,” the victim’s sister

Of course, finding the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>right words</a> can be a challenge, which is why we're here to help. Below, you'll find a comprehensive list of sympathies and sentiments to send to the bereaved, whatever your relationship to them may be. We've even broken the list down into categories so that you can put together the most impactful message based on the circumstances. Read on for more.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>136 "Thank You" Messages for Every Occasion</a>.</strong></p><h2><strong>Why Is It Important to Reach Out After Someone Dies?</strong></h2><p>Reaching out to express condolences isn't the kind of communication we look forward to having with friends or family, but loss is a fact of life. And we want to show up and be present for those we love, especially in tough times. According to a 2016 study published in the National Library of Medicine, writing a a simple sympathy note allows us to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-citation=true>recognize the pain</a>&nbsp;the grieving party is in.</p><p>Not only that, but the gesture might even help thwart the onset of mental health issues including anxiety and depression. The study compared two groups of grieving family members: One group received a condolence card from the physician managing their case, while the other did not. "Bereaved family members in this context need help, need to be recognized, need to be supported during their bereavement," the authors note.</p><p>Researchers maintain that this type of communication can do a lot to protect the wellbeing of those who have suffered a recent loss. Whether you choose to deliver your message in-person, over the phone, or in a sympathy card is up to you, though the study's authors did note that something immediate and handwritten is most well-received. Giving gifts, stopping by, and continuing to check in on your grieving friend or family member are also thoughtful ways to show your continued support.</p><h2><strong>Condolence Text Messages for Friends</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/condolence-messages-for-friends.jpg><li>Sending over my sincere condolences.

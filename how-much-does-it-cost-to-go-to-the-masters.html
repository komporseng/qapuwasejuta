Here's a comprehensive guide to understanding the costs associated with attending the Masters tournament.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Tickets</h2><ul data-mce-fragment=1><li data-mce-fragment=1>The most crucial expense for attending the Masters is the ticket. The tickets for the Masters are known for their exclusivity and limited availability, making them highly sought after.</li><li data-mce-fragment=1>The prices for Masters tickets vary depending on the day and type of ticket. Practice round tickets are generally less expensive than tournament round tickets.</li><li data-mce-fragment=1>The Masters operates a lottery system for practice round tickets, where applicants can enter for the chance to purchase tickets at face value. However, tournament round tickets are significantly harder to obtain and often require purchasing through authorized resellers or on the secondary market.</li><li data-mce-fragment=1>Prices for tournament round tickets can vary widely based on demand, with prices often reaching well into the thousands of dollars for the more coveted days, such as the weekend rounds.</li></ul><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Accommodation</h2><ul data-mce-fragment=1><li data-mce-fragment=1>Accommodation costs can vary greatly depending on the proximity to Augusta National Golf Club and the level of luxury desired.</li><li data-mce-fragment=1>Hotels and rental properties near Augusta typically experience a surge in prices during the week of the Masters due to high demand.

The process of qualifying for the Kentucky Derby is rigorous and involves a series of designated prep races known as the "Road to the Kentucky Derby." Let's delve into the comprehensive details of how horses qualify for this esteemed event.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Qualification Process Overview</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The field for the Kentucky Derby is limited to 20 horses, making the competition fierce. Only a minuscule 0.001% of the approximately 20,000 Thoroughbred foals born annually in the United States can participate in this iconic race. The qualification system underwent a complete overhaul in 2012, introducing a point system aligned with designated stakes races throughout the year, known as the "Road to the Kentucky Derby".</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The "Road to the Kentucky Derby"</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The "Road to the Kentucky Derby" is a series of designated stakes races held between September and April, offering points to the top four finishers in each race. There are 35 races across thirteen racetrack venues in seven states in the United States, with point values increasing as the Road progresses closer to the Kentucky Derby. The point values provided for each race increase as the Road progresses closer to the Kentucky Derby, with a significant boost in point values during the mid-February races and towards the end of March.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Point System and Qualification</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Earning points through participating in these races is crucial for qualification. Winning certain races with a specific number of points guarantees a spot in the starting gate at the Kentucky Derby. Additionally, finishing second in races with high point values can also secure a horse’s spot at the starting gate.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Lexington Stakes at Keeneland serves as a pre-finale "wild card" race, providing hopeful horses on the bubble of making the Derby field the opportunity to earn some last-minute points. After the final race, horses are given three weeks to prepare for the Kentucky Derby, with the winners of previous races usually considered the "expected favorites" on the first Saturday in May.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>International Qualification</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Kentucky Derby organization also introduced the beginning of the "Road" to the European and Japanese scene through a series of qualifying races. The horse with the highest points on each Road is invited to compete in the Kentucky Derby. In 2019, Master Fencer became the first horse on the Japan Road to the Derby to accept an invitation.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Notable Facts and Records</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Kentucky Derby has a rich history and is known for its notable facts and records, such as the record for the fastest Kentucky Derby winner set by Secretariat in 1973 and the record for most money wagered at the Kentucky Derby in 2023.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The process of qualifying for the Kentucky Derby is a rigorous and competitive journey for horses, owners, trainers, and jockeys. With a limited field of 20 horses, the Road to the Kentucky Derby plays a pivotal role in determining which horses earn the right to compete in this prestigious event. The qualification process, point system, and international participation all contribute to the excitement and anticipation surrounding the Kentucky Derby each year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hprBlnZa7unnHqKmsnaNivraty6KdsmWWpL9uwMeeZKSdnqnCpLfYZpueqpKu</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lego-masters-season-4-fox-1235461337.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lego Masters Renewed for Season 4 at Fox and Sets Second Celebrity Holiday Bricktacul</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hopsin-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hopsin's Net Worth (Updated 2024)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jalen-rose.html>Jalen Rose: Basketball Player, Real Name, NBA, Wife, Chris Webber, Net Worth!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jazzmyne-robbins.html>Jazzmyne Robbins - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Career, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheriff-stephen-gibson-obituary-glen-rose-tx-somervell-investigator-killed-in-crash.html>Sheriff Stephen Gibson Obituary, Glen Rose TX, Somervell Investigator Killed In Crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeremy-renner-no-regrets-snow-plow-accident-interview.html>Jeremy Renner Reveals He Has No Regrets About Snow Plow Accident After Almost Dying To Save His Neph</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mihir-ahuja.html>Mihir Ahuja- Wiki, Age, Height, Ethnicity, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL.

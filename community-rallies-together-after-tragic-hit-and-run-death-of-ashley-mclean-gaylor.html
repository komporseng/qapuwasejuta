The young woman was struck by a Honda Accord as she was crossing Lindbergh Avenue in the early hours of the morning. Medical responders arrived promptly, only to find Ashley had tragically succumbed to her injuries. The driver of the vehicle fled the scene, leaving a grieving community in shock.</p><p>Ashley McLean-Gaylor was the daughter of Leslie McLean, a police officer in Folcroft, a borough in Delaware County. In response to this devastating loss, the Delaware County Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) established a fundraising page to cover funeral expenses and to provide ongoing support for Ashley’s family. The FOP’s efforts have resonated with the community, as the fundraising page has already surpassed $66,000 of its $80,000 goal.</p><p>The authorities in Delaware County are determined to bring justice to Ashley’s memory. They have offered a $5,000 reward for any information that can lead to identifying the driver responsible for the hit-and-run. Thanks to additional contributions from the Fraternal Order of Police and an anonymous donor, the reward has grown to a substantial $15,000, underscoring the community’s commitment to seeking justice.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Some information said she got out of a car stepped into a moving lane of traffic!</p><p>— VisionZeroPHLFails (@ZEROVISIONPHIlL) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 26, 2023</a></p><p>Investigations are ongoing, with both the Sharon Hill Police Department and the Darby Township Police Department working together to uncover the truth behind this tragic incident. The case has garnered special attention due to Ashley’s mother’s affiliation with law enforcement, leading the Fraternal Order of Police to offer their support unofficially as well.</p><p>Chris Eiserman, President of FOP Lodge No.27, emphasized the urgency of the situation in a public statement:</p><p>“Our reward is payable immediately if someone calls police with a tip that leads to the suspected driver. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of this young mother from Delaware County.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Thomas Kesser, the organizer of the FOP-directed fundraiser, expressed the community’s deep sorrow over Ashley’s untimely passing and extended a plea for support:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Philadelphia’s deadliest hit & run year ever continued at 2:30 this morning <a href=# rel=noopener>@PhillyPolice</a> report.

Standing at just 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 meters) tall, Altuve has carved out a remarkable career in Major League Baseball (MLB) despite being one of the shortest players in the league.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Altuve's Height and Comparisons</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Altuve's height of 5 feet 6 inches makes him the shortest active player in Major League Baseball, and the shortest since Freddie Patek retired following the 1981 season. Additionally, Altuve's listed weight is 166 pounds (75 kg). To put his height into perspective, it's interesting to note that Altuve is an outlier in terms of height on the Houston Astros team, and in the entire MLB. He stands in stark contrast to some of the tallest players in baseball, such as Aaron Judge, who is 6-foot-7.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Altuve's Response to His Height</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite his unique physical stature, Altuve has embraced his height and even found humor in it. Inspired by broadcasters debating the distance of particular home runs, a web-based calculator was created to calculate distance in Official Standard Listed Altuves (OSLA). Altuve himself has expressed his amusement at the idea, stating, "It's funny, man... When they told me how many 'Altuves' was a home run, I just laughed".</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Historical Context of Altuve's Height</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Altuve's height of 5 feet 6 inches places him among the shortest players in MLB history. While the title of the shortest player in baseball history is disputed, Altuve's stature has not hindered his exceptional achievements in the sport. Despite being shorter than the average height of major-league players, which has hovered near 6 feet 1 inch over the past decade, Altuve has become one of baseball's most accomplished players.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Notable Achievements and Recognition</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Altuve's career highlights include being an eight-time All-Star, a 2017 World Series champion, and a former American League MVP. Furthermore, Altuve has solidified his place in MLB history by becoming one of the most prolific postseason home run hitters, with 23 home runs to his name.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Altuve's Impact on the Game</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Altuve's success in baseball challenges the traditional notion that taller players have inherent advantages in the sport. Despite his stature, Altuve has established himself as a premiere contact hitter, recording at least 200 hits each season from 2014 to 2017 and winning three batting championships in that span. His remarkable career statistics, including a career .307 batting average and nearing 2,000 career hits, underscore his exceptional abilities and impact on the game of baseball.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jose Altuve's height of 5 feet 6 inches has not hindered his ability to excel in Major League Baseball. His achievements, accolades, and impact on the game demonstrate that exceptional skill and determination can transcend physical stature. Altuve's success serves as an inspiration and a testament to the diversity of talent and skill in the sport of baseball, proving that greatness knows no height requirement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mikpZpfnby4edOao6Vlmah6q7vSnmSapKSqw6Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./julia-roberts-divorce-danny-moder-marriage-over-break-up-report.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Julia Robertss Divorce?

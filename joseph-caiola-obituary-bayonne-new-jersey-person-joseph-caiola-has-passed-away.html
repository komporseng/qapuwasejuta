In the following Guest Book, Legacy would like to extend an invitation to you to share your memories of Joseph and to express your condolences for his passing. On October 2, 2006, Joseph M. Caiola, a retired printer at Boise Cascade, passed away at Maefair Health Care Centre. He had been a member of the Maefair Health Care Centre for many years.</p><p>Trumbull was his home, and he was 81 years old at the time. He was born in Bridgeport on March 4, 1925, and his parents, Michael Caiola and Fortuna Caliano Caiola, both passed away before he was born. He was the son of both of his parents. In addition, he was a member of the VFW Post in Trumbull and volunteered his time at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centre in West Haven. He also offered his services to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. During World War II, he was a member of the forces of the United States Army.</p><p>In addition to being a loyal fan of the Boston Red Sox, Joe discovered that helping individuals who were in need at the Maefair Health Care Centre in Trumbull brought him a great deal of happiness. His sister, Sue Sherwood, as well as both of his brothers, Anthony Caiola and John Caiola, had already passed away prior to his passing. He was preceded in death by his wife, Dolores Caiola, who also passed away.</p><p>Some of the people who survived include a daughter named Joelle Classey who lives in Westerly, Rhode Island; four sons named Joseph Caiola, Jr. of Trumbull, John Caiola of Fairfield, Paul Caiola of Monroe, and Randall Caiola of Trumbull; a brother named Sam Caiola of Bridgeport; three sisters named Louise Gulas of Newtown, Lucy Yanosy of Bridgeport, and Mary Tompkins of Hamden; thirteen grandchildren, a great grandchild, and a sizeable number of nieces and nephews are also among the survivors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwts6snKmgXZiuqrvLmmSompmpwqK%2B2GaZmrGfo7umec2ermailafApsWMqZyrq5%2Bjequ70p6noWWTlrawuMBmn5qrXaWutL%2FEnWSar5GufA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kacy-hill.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kacy Hill</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./salt-n-pepa-makeup-collab-milani-cosmetics-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Its Timeless Like Us Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jalen-rose.html>Jalen Rose: Basketball Player, Real Name, NBA, Wife, Chris Webber, Net Worth!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jazzmyne-robbins.html>Jazzmyne Robbins - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Career, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheriff-stephen-gibson-obituary-glen-rose-tx-somervell-investigator-killed-in-crash.html>Sheriff Stephen Gibson Obituary, Glen Rose TX, Somervell Investigator Killed In Crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeremy-renner-no-regrets-snow-plow-accident-interview.html>Jeremy Renner Reveals He Has No Regrets About Snow Plow Accident After Almost Dying To Save His Neph</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mihir-ahuja.html>Mihir Ahuja- Wiki, Age, Height, Ethnicity, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL.

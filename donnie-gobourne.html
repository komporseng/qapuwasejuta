She is a power pitcher who struck out 89 batters in 64.2 innings. She struck out 9.7 times every seven innings. Donnie played in 17 games and made 14 starts for the Owls as a pitcher. The OKC Spark selected her 17th overall in the 2023 Women’s Professional Fastpitch Draft on April 17, 2023.</p><h3>Early Life&nbsp;</h3><p>On August 25, Donnie Gobourne was born to Shondra Crenshaw. Her parents separated when she was four years old and it was her mother who alone raised three daughters. She worked as an assistant manager at the cafeteria and always took care of the needs to raise her daughters.</p><p>Donnie still talks with her dad but she’s proud of her mother who provided all things they wanted.&nbsp;Growing up in Lake Placid, Florida, a peaceful, gorgeous town popular with retirees, Gobourne and her two older sisters didn’t have much to do besides play sports.&nbsp;</p><p>Softball was the initial love of all three sisters, inspired by their mother Shondra Crenshaw, who played in her youth but not at the college level like her children. Softball works as a type of North Star for Gobourne, providing a platform to keep her on track and on her way to college.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u10aea8e2ba7da52caea62c6974037465><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Maya Brady Biography</span></a><h3>Donnie Gobourne Career</h3><p>She participated on the All Highlands team for all four years of high school while playing under Gus Diez at Lake Placid High School.&nbsp;Her adventure as a pitcher truly began at Santa Fe College, a junior college in Florida, where she played from 2018 to 2020 and began working on her technique.</p><p>She improved significantly enough as a pitcher to begin receiving Division I interest, and she went on to pitch for the FAU Owls for two seasons. She had ERAs of 5.40 and 2.12, respectively, in her first and second seasons, which are vastly different from her performance in the SEC. In her third season, she had an ERA of 4.33 and finished 3-6.</p><p>During her sophomore year, she finished her first NCAA season by pitching 58.1 innings, ranking second on the team. She took part in 16 games, beginning 15, and finished two of them. Her best performance of the 2021 campaign came in an eight-inning, 1-0 victory over an NCAA tournament-bound USF squad.</p><p>She limited the Bulls to four hits, five walks, and two strikeouts. Her second complete game, a seven-inning contest against C-USA opponent Charlotte, featured a season-high eight strikeouts for the Owls as a team.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Donnie Gobourne Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Donnie Gobourne</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>25 August</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>20s</td></tr><tr><td>Hometown</td><td>Sebring, Florida, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Softball Player</td></tr><tr><td>College&nbsp;</td><td>University of South Carolina</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 8” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 172 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 75 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 165 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Donnie-Gobourne-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Shondra Crenshaw</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>Two (Marquis & Dierrica)</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Derric Jr.</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Boyfriend</td><td>&nbsp;None</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ue788868763e07b6902c440230255cbb8><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Luka Garza Biography</span></a><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>As far as her personal life is concerned, then she is single at the moment and only focusing on building her career.

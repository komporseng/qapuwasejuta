Carolyn Davis, born in 2009, Novalee Reign, born in 2015, and Vaeda Luma, born in 2019, are their three children to date. A fourth kid is also on the couple’s wish list.

Carolyn Elizabeth, also known as Carly by her adoptive parents, was their firstborn. Carly was given up for adoption by both of them when they were teenagers.

She and her husband, Tyler, also co-wrote the novel Conquering Chaos, which was released on March 3, 2015. Catelynn gave birth to their second child, Novalee Reign, on January 1, 2015.

This retirement marks the end of an illustrious 30-year wrestling career for the 14-time world champion and behind-the-scenes executive of <a href=#>WWE</a>. His decision to retire was driven by a series of health issues, particularly a cardiac event and viral pneumonia, which made it clear that it would not be safe for him to continue wrestling. Let's delve deeper into the reasons behind Triple H's retirement from WWE.</p><h2>Health Issues and Heart Condition</h2><li><strong>Serious Health Scare</strong>: Triple H's retirement was prompted by a cardiac event and viral pneumonia, which led to severe health concerns.</li><li><strong>Hospitalization</strong>: Following a bout of viral pneumonia, Triple H was hospitalized after his wife, <a href=#>Stephanie McMahon</a>, witnessed him coughing up blood. Doctors then informed him about the inflammation in his lungs and the buildup of fluid in his lungs and around his heart.</li><li><strong>Heart Failure</strong>: Triple H revealed that he was in "bad" heart failure and his heart was functioning at a fraction of its full strength, causing significant concern for his health and future well-being.</li><li><strong>Defibrillator Implant</strong>: As a result of his heart condition, doctors implanted a defibrillator in his chest to assist his heart, making it clear that it would not be advisable for him to engage in live TV <a href=#>wrestling</a> matches.</li><h2>Family Considerations</h2><li><strong>Impact on Family</strong>: Triple H emphasized the impact of his health scare on his family, particularly his three young daughters, aged 15, 13, and 11. He expressed concern about the potential consequences his health issues had on his family and the realization that his condition made him think differently about life.</li><li><strong>Appreciation for Family</strong>: He mentioned that his health scare made him appreciate his friends and family more, indicating a shift in perspective and priorities following the health scare.</li><h2>In-Ring Legacy and Executive Duties</h2><li><strong>In-Ring Legacy</strong>: Triple H's retirement signifies the end of an era for one of the most successful wrestlers in <a href=#>WWE</a> history. His legacy includes being a 14-time world champion, a five-time Intercontinental champion, a two-time tag team champion, a King of the Ring winner, and a two-time Royal Rumble winner.</li><li><strong>Transition to Executive Role</strong>: Despite retiring from in-ring competition, Triple H is expected to recover and return to his executive duties within WWE, specifically guiding the WWE developmental brand NXT, where he has been a key figure since 2012.</li><p>Triple H's retirement from WWE was primarily influenced by his health scare, which culminated in a serious heart condition that necessitated his withdrawal from in-ring competition. The impact on his family and the need to prioritize his health and well-being were pivotal factors in his decision. Despite the end of his in-ring career, Triple H's significant contributions to WWE as both a wrestler and an executive will continue to shape the <a href=#>wrestling</a> industry for years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0misn5tfrLW6ecOim2asop69rbGMoWSrnaSev6Z5xaumpmWnrLI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yfn-lucci-was-stabbed-in-jail-suspect-eppinger-charges-bond.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yfn Lucci Was Stabbed In Jail, Suspect Christian Eppinger Charges &amp;amp; Bond</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-lark-skov-cindy-crawford-niece-4829826.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Lark Skov?

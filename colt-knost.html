Colt Knost is also popular as a regular analyst and commentator for the PGA Tour.</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Colt Knost was born on <strong>26th June 1985</strong> in Garrettsville, Ohio, United States. With this, he is currently<strong> 36 years old</strong> and he is American by nationality. Likewise, he is a Christian from a religious point of view and his birth sign is Cancer.</p><p>Moving on to his family members, he was born to his father Don Paul, and his mother Luann Knost. His father died in a car accident when he was only 19 months old. Therefore, he never got the chance to recognize him.</p><p>However, he later transformed his name into Colt Christopher Paul Knost in his dad’s honor. Similarly, he moved to Texas with his family at the age of 4. His mother Luann was also a golfer but not a professional. This is how he got an interest in golf. He started playing golf at the age of 12.</p><h4>Education</h4><p>In terms of his educational status, he did his schooling at Pilot Point High School. He won his opening game in high school in his freshman year. Along with golf, he also played basketball, soccer, and football. Likewise, he did his higher education at Southern Methodist University.</p><h2><span id=Colt_Knost_8211_Professional_Life_and_Career>Colt Knost – Professional Life and Career</span></h2><p>Colt Knost began his professional career while still a student. He was named Western Athletic Conference Freshman of the Year for his outstanding abilities. In the same year, he competed for the United States in the Walker Cup. Following that, the 2007 US Amateur went professional, forfeiting his invitations to the Open Championship, US Open, and Masters.</p><p>As an authority on the PGA Tour, he frolicked in three transactions. Similarly, the promising golfer first went to the licensing department to get his PGA Tour card for the next year. Unfortunately, his performance on T-85 was not up to par. He then participated in the Countrywide Trip in 2008, winning the Fort Smith Classic and the Price Cutter Charity Championship.</p><p>Moving on, Colt finished sixth on the money list, earning his PGA Tour card for the first time. However, this did not turn out well for him. He only made 11 of 24 cuts, therefore he finished 193rd on the money list and went on a cross-country journey the next year. Moreover, his situation was dire at the time, but as the light at the end of the tunnel, he was able to reclaim his PGA Tour card.</p><p>His career did not have a good year in 2012 and 2013, as he battled to keep his PGA Tour card. He returned to the web.com Tour as a result of this. Also, he didn’t want to stay on the web.com circuit, so he fought tirelessly to return to the PGA Tour in 2015.</p><p>He was able to re-enter the circuit in 2015, proving that hard effort trumps skill and luck. That year, he ended the season with a higher rating and was able to keep his tour card for another year. He missed the cut in the Waste Management Phoenix Open in 2020, hence he announced his retirement from the game.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-197978 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Colt-playing-golf.jpg alt="Colt Knost" width=650 height=358 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-197978 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Colt playing golf (Source: TJGT)</p><h4>Net Worth 2023</h4><p>The retired golfer has made a pretty handful amount of wealth.

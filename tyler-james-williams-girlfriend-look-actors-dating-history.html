However, his offscreen affairs seem to fizzle out almost as soon as they hit the headlines.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Hence, details about the life of Tyler James Williams and information about his present girlfriend seem to have eluded the public.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Tyler_James_Williams_Have_A_Girlfriend></span><strong>Does Tyler James Williams Have A Girlfriend?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tyler James Williams has not been linked with any woman recently, making it safe to say he has no wife or girlfriend. He has also <a href=#>never been married</a>, nor has any known kids.</p><p>While Williams has never married, he has lived through several relationships in the past, which made their way to the tabloids. He also became embroiled in dating rumors with the likes of Keke Palmer which went unconfirmed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Were_Tyler_James_Williams_Previous_Girlfriends></span><strong>Who Were Tyler James Williams’ Previous Girlfriends?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although it is currently unclear whether or not Tyler James Williams is dating anyone at the moment, a bit is known about the identities of some of his exes.</p><p>His last known romance was with Russian-American model and actress Anastasia Baranova. Before that, he had a thing with singer Karina Pasian. However, the exact timeline of both <a href=#>relationships</a> remains unclear.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Anastasia_Baranova></span><strong>Anastasia Baranova</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Williams and model Anastasia Baranova reportedly kicked off their affair sometime around 2015, when rumors about their involvement began to swirl. However, neither addressed the dating rumors nor made any move suggesting a budding romance for years.</p><p>That changed in 2017 when they shared a series of photos on Instagram showing them together. Their romance flourished for a while until fans noticed they deleted photos of each other on social media, signifying the end of their romance.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Karina_Pasian></span><strong>Karina Pasian</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CakhYYfoHbs/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=</p></figure><p>Before kicking things off with Baranova, Tyler James Williams was linked with another girlfriend Karina Pasian. Although it is unclear when the former couple began dating, it appears they called things off sometime in 2015.</p><p>Williams and the “Solitaire” crooner never made their romance public nor confirmed it. However, they attended several events as a couple throughout their relationship. Additionally, the “Abbot Elementary” star appeared in the music video of “Solitaire” in 2014.</p><p>The icon also took to social media on occasions to gush about his girlfriend. In a 2013 tweet, William supposedly bragged about his “girlfriend’s” voice, saying “my girlfriend sings better than yours,” and tagging Pasian in the post.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Were_Keke_Palmer_And_Tyler_James_Williams_Ever_A_Couple></span><strong>Were Keke Palmer And Tyler James Williams Ever A Couple?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/20220529_224754.jpg><p>Another high-profile figure embroiled in Williams’ <a href=#>dating history</a> is Keke Palmer, the actress and TV host. The two were rumored to have dated as teenagers, at the onset of their respective careers.</p><p>According to reports, the 29-year-old and the “Akeelah And The Bee” actress split in 2008, after about eighteen months together. They went on to forge ahead in their careers, becoming household names.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Williams_Preference_In_Women></span><strong>What Is Williams’ Preference In Women?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since his split from Baranova, Wiliams seems to have taken a step back from the dating game. Yet, his romantic life and preferences have been subject to media speculation.</p><p>In 2018, “The Walking Dead” actor faced backlash after an alleged tweet from him dishing out anti-black women statements surfaced. The derogatory post implied the icon preferred women “on the other side” rather than “self-entitled black women.”</p><p>However, Williams wouldn’t have that. He took to social media immediately to debunk the tweet, calling the poster out for impersonating him. He went on to <a href=#>clarify</a>:</p><p><strong>“I date who I date because that’s who I vibe with at the time. Any ethnicity. The grass isn’t greener anywhere.”</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>After addressing the racial discrepancies in the post, the star finally put the hearts of his numerous fans to rest. Clearing the air at the nick of time certainly stopped Williams from joining the league of <a href=#>celebrities canceled</a> over their questionable, discriminative remarks on social media over race, sexuality or other sensitive subjects.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwbq4xKtko5mdmsBuw8ilo6KZnah6qLXRpZ2roZWjsW64zqiiZpmTqbyzv4ydmK2hnpx6qbXSraarsV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-moneybagg-yo-related-to-crunchy-black.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Moneybagg Yo related to Crunchy Black?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-tait.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Tait</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jalen-rose.html>Jalen Rose: Basketball Player, Real Name, NBA, Wife, Chris Webber, Net Worth!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jazzmyne-robbins.html>Jazzmyne Robbins - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Career, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheriff-stephen-gibson-obituary-glen-rose-tx-somervell-investigator-killed-in-crash.html>Sheriff Stephen Gibson Obituary, Glen Rose TX, Somervell Investigator Killed In Crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeremy-renner-no-regrets-snow-plow-accident-interview.html>Jeremy Renner Reveals He Has No Regrets About Snow Plow Accident After Almost Dying To Save His Neph</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mihir-ahuja.html>Mihir Ahuja- Wiki, Age, Height, Ethnicity, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL.

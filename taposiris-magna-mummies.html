Coins that depicted the queen’s face were found there in the past, which suggested that the temples there were in use during her reign. Then last week, the site yielded a 2,000-year-old mummy — with a golden tongue.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to</a> LiveScience, the temples at Taposiris Magna were built to honor the god of the underworld Osiris and his wife Isis. It was among this expansive plot of land in western Alexandria where an international research team uncovered 16 ancient burials brimming with invaluable relics, including the golden tongued-mummy.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-314787 alt="Statues Found At Taposiris Magna" width=900 height=684 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/statues-found-at-taposiris-magna.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-314787 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Twitter</span><span class=caption-body>These busts, which were found in the same excavation that yielded the gold tongue, were dated back to the Greek and Roman eras of classical antiquity.</span></p><p>Experts aren’t clear why this mummy’s tongue was made out of gold, but one theory posits that it was meant to give the dead the ability to speak in the afterlife. Indeed, experts think that perhaps this mummy had a speech impediment and that this gold tongue would give them agency to speak with the god of the dead.</p><p>Archaeologists estimate that the gold-tongued mummy either lived during the reign of Ptolemy between 340 B.C. to 30 B.C. or the Roman Empire, which took control of Egypt after Cleopatra died in 30 B.C.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-314784 alt="Taposiris Magna Statue" width=800 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/taposiris-magna-statue.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-314784 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities</span><span class=caption-body>Several statues depicting the buried were found in excellent condition.</span></p><p>The other 15 burials contained similarly exciting finds. One mummy was found donning the crown of the Egyptian god Atef, which was also decorated with horns and a cobra at the forehead. This mummy also boasted a necklace depicting a falcon’s head.</p><p>Another mummy was found buried with a funerary death mask as well as eight marble masks dated to the Greek and Roman eras of classical antiquity. Two other mummies, meanwhile, were found buried with scrolls that experts are now attempting to decode.</p><p>Researchers also found what appeared to be statues depicting the people buried there. These are so well preserved that the individual’s hairstyles and headdresses are still discernible.</p><p>Ultimately, experts are still asking who these mummies were and how as well as when, exactly, they died.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-314783 alt="Taposiris Magna Death Mask" width=800 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/taposiris-magna-death-mask.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-314783 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities</span><span class=caption-body>This woman’s death mask covered nearly her entire body and left her appearing to be smiling.</span></p><p>The excavation <a href=# rel=noopener>was led</a> by archaeologist Kathleen Martinez, who has been unearthing ancient Egyptian artifacts since 2002.</p><p>In addition to this latest haul, Martinez has discovered more than 27 tombs.

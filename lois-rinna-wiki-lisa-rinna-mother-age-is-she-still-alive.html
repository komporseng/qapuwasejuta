She let her heart out that there wasn’t any handbook nor anyone who taught her that it was ok to let go. “There’s never a way to be ready to let go,” she cried.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But who is Lisa’s mother? Is she still alive? Get to know her more as this Lois Rinna Wiki proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Lois Rinna, Lisa Rinna’s Mother</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Lois Rinna is most popular as Lisa Rinna’s mother to the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> fans. She has made several appearances with her daughter on the Netflix series. To be precise, she has appeared in 10 episodes of ROHB before she suffered from a stroke in 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her first appearance was back in 2014 or the episode titled “Pay Attention to Me!”, while her last (then) was in the 2021 ep titled “Reunion Part 2.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Previously, she has also appeared on the show </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Harry Loves Lisa</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2010.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After the news about her stroke came to light, Lois’s granddaughter Amelia Gray Hamlin, then 20, commented on the video, “Love you nana, forever.” While her other granddaughter, Delilah Belle Hamlin, then 23, wrote, “I have no words. I love you forever nana FaceTiming you today and laughing then crying with you was one of the hardest things I’ve had to do.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, ROHB stars like Kyle Richards, Teddi Mellencamp, Erika Jayne, Garcelle Beauvais, and Crystal Kung Minkoff, also made it to the comments with well-wishes and prayers</span></p><h3><b>Is Lisa Rinna’s Mother Lois Rinna Still Alive?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, as of November 2021, Lisa Rinna’s mother Lois was still alive.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Lisa, she was with Lois then, and she needed prayers for her mother. Also, she took to the time out while Lois was in the hospital to celebrate her over IG and send “so much love while she transitions.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Lois Rinna is a survivor.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She previously won the battle against her breast cancer, and also later survived a stroke in 2013. Yes, if you didn’t know this was her second stroke in 8 years. Her first stroke left her months of rehabilitation, learning how to walk and talk again. Though she was one of the lucky ones, she wasn’t the same after her first stroke.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As if the medical problems weren’t enough, Lois also was notably attacked by David Carpenter, the man who became known as the Trailside Killer in 1960. Reports said that she was picked up by the killer at the bus stop, who drove her down the deserted road. Then, he attempted to rape her and possibly kill her. But luckily, a military policeman saw them drive down this deserted road (where no one was supposed to go). So, he followed them and saved Lois.</span></p><h3><b>Where Does Lois Rinna Live?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Lois Rinna lived in Beaverton, Oregon, before she suffered from a stroke in 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Whereas, Lisa lived in a $4 million custom mansion in Beverly Hills.</span></p><h3><b>Lois Rinna Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Lois Rinna was 93 years of age in 2021 when she suffered from a stroke.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She was born on June 7, 1928, and is of the Gemini zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Lois Rinna Husband, Kids</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Lois Rinna’s husband Frank Rinna was a longtime Medford resident and artist, who left this world on January 21, 2016, at the age of 93 (the same age when Lois suffered from a stroke in 2021).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her husband was enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1942 and went on to retire in 1946. He was a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>College of Arts and Crafts</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> alumna who later worked as a staff artist for the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>San Francisco Chronicle</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> as well as did some freelance work with </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Standard Oil, Chevron,</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>PG&E</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But it wasn’t until 1988, he pursued his first love, watercolor painting. Frank was also commissioned for many paintings and sculptures by residents and businesses.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Lois’s kids, she shares two daughters with her husband Frank. The ROHB star Lisa needs no introduction, while her second daughter Nancy went on to marry into the DeLand family and had a kid named Traci DeLand Ryde.</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span style=font-weight:400>Frank has also appeared over a ROHB episode titled “Medford, 90210” in 2014.

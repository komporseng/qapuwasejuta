The Emmy-winning comic started her journey as a stand-up comedian in the 80s and quickly landed the title of Showtime's "funniest person in America." &nbsp;</p><p>DeGeneres's life took a surprise turn in 1997 when she famously came out as gay on the cover of Time magazine, making the time a pivotal moment in Hollywood history. The comedian has since been an imposing figure in the LGBTQ community. Ellen has been blessed in life's two most crucial departments- career and love. The comedian-turned-host and her partner, <strong>Portia de Rossi</strong>, have been married for over a decade. &nbsp;</p><h2>The Complete Timeline of Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi's Relationship! &nbsp;</h2><p>DeGeneres has never been the one to keep things away from her fans.

Ellen and Portia's love story deserves a sweet rom-com flick of its own, as the duo's journey has been nothing but a blissful and adventurous ride. &nbsp;</p><p>Ellen first met Portia at a Rock the Vote concert in 2001. A spark was lit between the two at the immediate moment, as they'll recall it years later, but since Portia had yet to come out of the closet, in fear of ruining her career, the pair had no choice but to wait as life takes its course. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/6/368412566_679621374034107_3769960868308277556_n%20(1)%20(1)-1701892126364.jpg><p>When the two ran into each other again in 2004, Ellen and Portia were in committed relationships with other people. The duo decided to start their relationship on the right foot and confronted their then-respective partners before kick-starting their romance. &nbsp;</p><p>One month into their dating bliss, the couple made it official by attending a Golden Globe Awards after-party in January 2005. "My feelings for her overrode all of my fear about being out as a lesbian," <a href=#>Portia gushed</a> shortly after going public with the comedian. The two knew they were the perfect fit for each other from the get-go and dished on it several times. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The couple shares their secrets to a healthy relationship! &nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>"If it were legal, we would be married, but it's not legal," said the Ellen DeGeneres Show host as she elucidated the plight of the gay community.

Like any other straight Hollywood power couple, the duo has also shared their secret to keep a marriage going. &nbsp;</p><p>As per the Emmy winner, consistently putting their marriage above their careers and being grateful top the list. The pair's very public relationship also includes the spouses making big sweet gestures for each other, like when de Rossi gifted DeGeneres a gorilla sanctuary for her 60th birthday. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/6/33210190_238862980026739_1943871845635719168_n%20(1)%20(1)-1701892145054.jpg><p>Throughout their decade-long relationship, the couple had navigated many bumps, including when Ellen was embattled amid the workplace controversy in 2020.

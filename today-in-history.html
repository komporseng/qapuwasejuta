His bold speech came as he suggested that Virginia should raise an independent militia to fight in what he saw as an inevitable conflict against the British. His statement in full was:</p><p>“Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”</p><h2>1903: The Wright Brothers File A Patent For The Airplane</h2><p>Orville and Wilbur Wright file a patent application for what they call a <a href=# rel=noopener>“Flying Machine”</a> several months before their first successful flight. Their initial application was denied, so they then hired an Ohio patent attorney named Henry Toulmin to help them in their endeavor. With Toulmin’s aid, the brothers were finally granted U.S. Patent 821,393 in May 1906, and they have gone down in history as the inventors of the airplane.</p><h2>1919: Mussolini Founds The Fascist Party</h2><p>Future Italian dictator Benito Mussolini establishes the Fasci di Combattimento, commonly known as the <a href=# rel=noopener>Fascist Party</a>. This right-wing group advocated Italian nationalism and partook in violent intimidation tactics against leftists as well as any and all enemies, perceived and otherwise. The Blackshirts, so called because of the dark clothing they wore, went on to march on Rome in 1922, and by 1925, Italy was proclaimed a Fascist state with Mussolini as its leader.</p><h2>1970: Carlo Gambino Is Arrested</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-414148 alt="Carlo Gambino" width=900 height=606 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gambino-arrested.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-414148 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Carlo Gambino’s 1970 arrest.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Carlo Gambino</a>, the Mafia’s “boss of all bosses,” is arrested for conspiracy to hijack an armored vehicle carrying $3 million in cash. His bail was set at $75,000, but Gambino initially refused to post it, declaring: “I’ll stay in jail. I’m innocent from this accusation and won’t put up five cents for bail.” He eventually relented. However, Gambino never faced trial for the crime due to his failing health, and he died six years later after suffering a massive heart attack.</p><h2>2011: Élan School Announces Its Closing</h2><p>The notorious <a href=# rel=noopener>Élan school</a> in Maine announces its closing. First opened in 1970 as a reform school for wayward youth, the Élan school gained a reputation as a “hellhole.” Former students claimed that school staff humiliated, restrained, and isolated them. In 1982, a student even died at the school. Its legacy is deeply controversial, with former students both decrying and praising the institution.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u8OasGahnmK1qr%2FTqKmyZ52Wv6S0jGtq</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./allu-bobby.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Allu Bobby - Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Career, Wiki, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./new-series-pocket-monsters-pok-c3-a9mon-investigation-team.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>New Series Pocket Monsters Pokmon Investigation Team</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jalen-rose.html>Jalen Rose: Basketball Player, Real Name, NBA, Wife, Chris Webber, Net Worth!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jazzmyne-robbins.html>Jazzmyne Robbins - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Career, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheriff-stephen-gibson-obituary-glen-rose-tx-somervell-investigator-killed-in-crash.html>Sheriff Stephen Gibson Obituary, Glen Rose TX, Somervell Investigator Killed In Crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeremy-renner-no-regrets-snow-plow-accident-interview.html>Jeremy Renner Reveals He Has No Regrets About Snow Plow Accident After Almost Dying To Save His Neph</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mihir-ahuja.html>Mihir Ahuja- Wiki, Age, Height, Ethnicity, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL.

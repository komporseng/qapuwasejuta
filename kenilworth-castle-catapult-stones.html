Now, historians hope they may reveal more about the history of what was once the home of royals and noblemen alike.</p><h2>Construction Workers Discover Catapult Stones In England</h2><p>While making recent accessibility upgrades on the grounds of Kenilworth Castle near Birmingham, England, construction workers stumbled upon a piece of medieval history. Just outside the castle walls, they discovered eight “perfectly preserved” catapult shots of various sizes. The smallest stone weighs just two pounds, while the largest weighs 230 pounds.</p><p>As for the age of the stones, historians believe they were fired during a famous siege by King Henry III in 1266.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-495614 alt="Kenilworth Castle" width=900 height=551 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kenilworth-castle.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-495614 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>English Heritage</span><span class=caption-body>Kenilworth Castle in central England.</span></p><p>“We were able to immediately link these findings to the 1266 siege because of similar finds recovered in the 1960s,” Will Wyeth, English Heritage’s properties historian, told the <a href=# rel=noopener>BBC</a>.</p><p>“However, it’s not every day we get lucky enough to stumble across historical remains like this by chance,” Wyeth continued. “Imagine the surprise of the team when we unearthed these impressive stone projectiles that are nearly 800 years old.”</p><p>Now, these catapult shots are shedding new light on what is believed to be the longest siege in medieval English history.</p><h2>Inside The Siege Of Kenilworth Castle</h2><p>In 1264, the Second Barons’ War broke out between royalist forces and a group of noble rebels led by Simon de Montfort. The rebels had control of Kenilworth Castle, and in June 1266, King Henry III’s men laid siege to the fortress.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-495625 alt="King Henry III" width=710 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/king-henry-iii.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-495625 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>King Henry III in a 13th-century manuscript.</span></p><p>The siege lasted 172 days, and during that time, the king’s troops attacked the castle with catapults and crossbows. The rebels inside had catapults of their own, and experts believe the stones discovered recently were fired from both sides.</p><p>Wyeth told the BBC that the catapult shots “would have caused some serious damage when fired from war machines. In fact, records show that one of <a href=# rel=noopener>Henry III</a>‘s wooden siege towers, containing around 200 crossbowmen, was destroyed by just one well-aimed missile.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-495613 alt="Worker With Catapult Stones" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/worker-with-catapult-stones.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-495613 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>English Heritage</span><span class=caption-body>An English Heritage representative inspects the catapult stones.</span></p><p>The siege ended in December 1266 when the rebels surrendered due to disease and starvation. Kenilworth Castle returned to the hands of the monarchy, and over the following centuries, it was the site of several important events in royal history.</p><p>In 1327, Edward II was at Kenilworth when he agreed to abdicate from the throne so his son could be crowned king. And in 1575, Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, hosted a three-week-long party at the castle in an attempt to win the heart of Queen Elizabeth I.</p><p>Now, 800 years after these stones were last used in battle, they’ve been exposed once more to serve as a reminder of Kenilworth Castle’s rich history.</p><p>After reading about the catapult stones found at Kenilworth Castle, go inside <a href=#>seven haunted castles</a> around the world.

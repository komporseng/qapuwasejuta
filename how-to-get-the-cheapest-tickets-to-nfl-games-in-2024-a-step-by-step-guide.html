From leveraging the secondary market to timing your purchase just right, this step-by-step guide will provide you with detailed insights on how to save money on NFL game tickets in 2024.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>NFL Ticket Prices</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Before delving into the strategies to get the cheapest NFL tickets, it's crucial to understand the dynamics of NFL ticket prices. According to Bookies.com, the face value of all NFL tickets averages about $110, with the cheapest seats in an NFL stadium averaging almost $439. However, the price varies widely, with some tickets costing close to $889 for popular games like the San Francisco 49ers at home, while others, such as the Arizona Cardinals, are priced at $169. Understanding these price variations is essential when planning to purchase NFL tickets.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Leveraging the Secondary Market</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Patience is Key</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>When it comes to buying secondary-market NFL tickets, patience is a virtue. According to a study by FinanceBuzz, fans who waited until the week of the game paid 18% less than average for their seats, amounting to a savings of nearly $40 per ticket. Furthermore, the lowest-priced tickets were sold on the same day as the game, offering a staggering 29% discount compared to the average resale price.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Best Time to Buy</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>The study also revealed that waiting until game day is the best time to buy a ticket to an NFL game, with tickets on game day being 29% cheaper than average, yet only 4% of resale tickets are sold that day. Therefore, it's recommended to check ticket listings often and make the purchase whenever suitable seats are found.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Team-Specific Savings</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>It's important to note that the rapid price drop trend during the week of the game applied to 31 of the 32 NFL teams last season, with fans of all teams, except the Indianapolis Colts, being able to save more than average by waiting until the week of the game to buy resale tickets. Moreover, some fan bases, such as the Seattle Seahawks, New Orleans Saints, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Buffalo Bills, saved over 30% on average by being patient with their ticket purchases.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Tips for Saving Money While Supporting Your Favorite NFL Team</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Aside from leveraging the secondary market, here are some additional tips for saving money while supporting your favorite NFL team:</p><ul data-mce-fragment=1><li data-mce-fragment=1><strong data-mce-fragment=1>Cut the Cord</strong>: For those planning on watching at home, find the cheapest ways to stream your team games.</li><li data-mce-fragment=1><strong data-mce-fragment=1>Shop Online for Team Gear</strong>: Compare prices for team gear when looking for your next jersey.</li><li data-mce-fragment=1><strong data-mce-fragment=1>Earn Perks and Rewards with Ticket Purchases</strong>: Certain credit cards offer bonuses on entertainment purchases, such as NFL tickets.</li></ul><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Best Practices for Buying NFL Tickets</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Timing Your Purchase</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>According to SeatGeek, it's actually better to make a purchase just a few days before the game. NFL fans pay 29% less on tickets bought within two weeks of a game instead of more than a month in advance. However, the exception is for "popular" games, where it's recommended to secure tickets earlier due to higher demand.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Quantity Considerations</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>If you plan to purchase a larger quantity of tickets, it's essential to be mindful of timing. SeatGeek advises that while waiting until just a few days before the game is ideal for buying one or two tickets, it becomes more difficult to find seats together in larger quantities, so you shouldn't wait too long in such cases.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Beating Additional Costs: Parking and Ridesharing</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Aside from ticket costs, it's important to consider other expenses associated with attending NFL games. One cost-saving strategy is to drive close to the stadium, find a free or cheap parking space, and then book a ridesharing service to take you to the game. Many venues have convenient designated areas for rideshare pickup and drop off, offering a way to save on parking and transportation costs.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The NFL Experience for Families</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>According to Bookies.com, it costs an average of $537 for two adults and two kids to attend an NFL game when considering the price of four of the cheapest tickets, stadium parking, and one drink and hot dog per person. However, the actual price varies significantly. Therefore, for families, it's crucial to take small steps to save money along the way, from finding cheap NFL tickets to scoring NFL apparel for less.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Exploring Alternate Game Locations</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>For those living in expensive NFL markets, it can be worth considering a trip to a cheaper road game. By exploring alternate game locations, fans can potentially save significantly on ticket costs, as demonstrated by the price disparities for games involving teams such as the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Ravens.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Super Bowl 2024: Ticket Purchase Tips</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>For those interested in attending the Super Bowl in 2024, it's important to note that individual ticket prices historically range between $4,000 and $6,000. Ticketmaster recommends checking listings often and making the purchase whenever suitable seats are found. Additionally, Ticketmaster offers both Verified Resale tickets and VIP packages, providing various options for fans looking to secure their Super Bowl tickets.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>By leveraging the secondary market, timing purchases strategically, and being mindful of additional costs, football fans can effectively secure the cheapest tickets to NFL games in 2024. Whether it's for regular season games or the highly anticipated Super Bowl, these strategies and tips can help fans save money while enjoying the electrifying experience of live NFL action.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The key to getting the cheapest NFL tickets lies in being patient, strategic, and thorough in your approach to ticket purchases.

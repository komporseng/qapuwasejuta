He appears to be the victim of yet another internet celebrity death scam.</p><p>There are no confirmed or official reports of the rapper becoming sick, getting into an accident, or experiencing any unlucky incidents. The origin of the death rumors is unknown.</p><p>38-year-old is healthy and alive. Contrary to rumors, Cole is busy and constantly putting out new music.</p><p>He just released a new song called “Procrastination (Broke),” much to his fans’ astonishment. He claims that he looked for “J. Cole type beat” on YouTube to find the beat.</p><p>He also permitted the song to be dropped on his channel by the producer. Cole’s text to the producer became the cover art.</p><p>Beats by the producer Bvtman that pay homage to musicians like J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, 21 Savage, Drake, Nipsey Hussle, and others can be found on his YouTube page.</p><p>Cole was in a funk until he heard the “Procrastination” beat, which inspired him to start writing.</p><p>Bvtman remembered the incredible moment when, while on the freeway, Cole’s longtime manager Ibrahim “IB” Hamad sent him a text message at random.</p><h2><span id=Discovering_J_Cole8217s_Family_and_Ethnicity>Discovering J Cole’s Family and Ethnicity</span></h2><p>Jermaine Lamarr Cole was born to Kay and an unidentified father at an American military base in Frankfurt, West Germany.</p><p>His mother, Kay, is an American of European descent who worked for the USPS as a mail carrier and an actor. His father served in the US army as an African-American.</p><p>When Cole was a little child, his father left the household. He and his older brother Zach’s mother moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina, when he was eight months old.</p><p>While living in Fayetteville, Cole held part-time employment as a bill collector, a file clerk, a newspaper ad salesman, and a kangaroo mascot at a skating rink.</p><p>In January 2015, the rapper made the decision to provide rent-free housing for single mothers in his childhood home in Fayetteville.</p><p>Cole is African-American through his father and has Irish, German, English, and Scottish ancestry through his mother’s side, according to Ethnicelebs.</p><p>He claims he can empathize with white people since he grew raised in a multicultural setting, even though he feels more like a person of color.</p><p>Cole became interested in basketball and music as a child, and at the age of 12, he began rapping. In 2000, when his mother gave him an ASR-X musical sampler for Christmas, he thought of it as the ideal vocation.</p><p>Melissa Heholt and J. Cole met at St. John’s University, where Melissa later became his wife. Two kids were born to the couple.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: A Look At The Success And Relationships Of Joan- Baez"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://superstarsculture.com/a-look-at-the-success-and-relationships-of-joan-baez-2/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/a-look-at-the-success-and-relationships-of-joan-baez-2/"}{"1":64}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>A Look At The Success And Relationships Of Joan- Baez</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Rapper</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Are Marcus And Lilian Thuram Related?

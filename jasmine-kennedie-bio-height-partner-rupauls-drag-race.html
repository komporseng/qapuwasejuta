So, she learned how to make up from her sister and Youtube videos and started from there. </span><span>Over time, with more experimentation, she then finally realized her gift. “I feel I paint more on the ‘old way’ of drag: a lot of powder, and seven different colors for contour. Taking off my makeup takes as much effort as getting to the center of a Tootsie Pop,” she said.</span></p><p>Within no time, she got so popular that <span>she even was featured in the Cosmopolitan magazine before she appeared on </span><i><span>RuPaul’s Drag Race</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><p><span>However, Jasmine wasn’t always into the arts. She was more of an athletic person.

However, after high school, he went on to begin his career in bartending and worked there almost all his life.</span></p><p><span>As for her mother, Jasmine shared that Joy was the “best mom anyone could ask for.” Also, recalling the time her mother found out that she did drag, Jasmine shared, “She said ‘if you’re going to be a drag queen. you’re gonna be a classy one.’”</span></p><p><span>Great job, Mom!</span></p><p><span>Also, Joy Bell celebrates her birthday on March 20.</span></p><p><span>Talking about her sister, Carlee is a nature enthusiast who studied Ecology at SUNY Plattsburgh.
